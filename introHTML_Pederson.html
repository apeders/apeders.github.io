     Hello! My name is Andy Pederson. I live in Lincoln, Nebraska with my wife Courtney. We have three cats and a dog. My hobbies include video games, film, and playing bass guitar. I received my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2012. I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am a little over halfway through this MLIS program. I work full-time at the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. We develop digital humanities websites and software. I have some basic HTML, CSS, and XML skills. I really enjoy using CSS.  I also have some experience with GitHub. I look forward to applying what I learn in this class to my job.
